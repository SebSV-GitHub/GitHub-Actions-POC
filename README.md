# GitHub Actions POC

üìù Proof of Concept üöÄ

Welcome to my GitHub Actions proof of concept! üòÑ

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of how actions work,
and how it deploys the portfolio contained in it's source code.
. I'm excited to share it with you! üí°

To get started, simply follow these steps:

0Ô∏è‚É£  Fork the repository (Don't forget to update your secrets and variables)
1Ô∏è‚É£  Clone the repository to your local machine
2Ô∏è‚É£  Make some changes
3Ô∏è‚É£  Push to origin/main

That's it! üéâ

We hope you find this POC informative and useful. If you have any feedback or 
suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me. I'm always looking for ways 
to improve. üòä

Thank you for taking the time to check out this project! üëçüëã

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è  This is just a simple README, there is a lot more behind, I'll upload more information later on.
